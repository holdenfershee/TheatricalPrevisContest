Please note: the Windows version of the Capture Presentation File will be posted ASAP - probably within 24 hours. My apologies, there was a last minute problem and I'm working to get it resolved. The MacOS version is available now.

On Monday, May 18th, I'll be going live on YouTube at 1:00pm EDT to do a walkthrough of the Capture file, explaining how the DMX-controlled scenery and masking works, and answering any questions that you might have. That video will be available within a couple hours of the live stream. www.youtube.com/mikewoodld.

Please see the FAQ on the contest website.
